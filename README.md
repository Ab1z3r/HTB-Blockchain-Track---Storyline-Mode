# HTB Blockchain track challenges (Following storyline)

This project is my solutions to the blockchain challenges on HTB but in web3.js

To run the test, Replace the RPC url and Private Key in the `hardhat.config.js`

Then go to the corresponding test.js and replace SETUP / PLAYER_ADDRESS

Run exploit with: 
`npx hardhat run test/<Challenge-Folder-Name>/test.js --network htb`
